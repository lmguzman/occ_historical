1. All species are everywhere, no ranges, MS_all_all, MS_all_visits vs MS_all_detected for more than 2 eras <- this would be useful for a scenario that has small spatial scale 

2. Visit patterns not the same for all species? visits independent for each species or same visits mu.v.yr = 0.5
  2.1 mu.v.yr = 0
  2.2 community visits vs individual visits 

3. same 1  with species ranges (using log normal) MS_all_all*(model but data simulated with ranges), MS_range_all (modelling with missing visits), MS_range_detected, MS_range_visits, take the best model and look at different ranges <- visit are the same for all species 
  - For modelling this we need to have polygons or something it needs to be spatially explicit. 

4. same 2  with species ranges (using log normal) MS_all_all*(model but data simulated with ranges), MS_range_all (modelling with missing visits), MS_range_detected, MS_range_visits, take the best model and look at different ranges <- each visit is independent for each species 

5. case study
